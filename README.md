# Protein Design and Mutation Analysis

This repository contains a set of Colab notebooks designed for protein design and mutation analysis using ProtGPT2, ESM2, and PyRosetta. Each notebook includes code and instructions for using state-of-the-art models and tools to predict and analyze protein mutations.

## Notebooks

### 1. ProtGPT2: Protein Sequence Generation

- **Description**: This notebook uses ProtGPT2, a generative language model specialized in protein sequences, to design novel proteins. It demonstrates the generation of plausible protein sequences based on a given input or prompt.

### 2. ESM2: Protein Language Model infilling

- **Description**: In this notebook, we utilize ESM2, a protein language model, generate new sequences using ESM2 infilling. ESM2 provides insights into the properties and potential functionality of protein sequences through embeddings and predictions.

### 3. PyRosetta Mutation Analysis

- **Description**: This notebook leverages PyRosetta to perform deep mutation scanning analysis, allowing users to predict the stability and functional impact of mutations.


### 4. ColabFold

- **Description**: This notebook uses ColabFold, an open-source implementation of AlphaFold, for protein structure prediction. ColabFold allows users to predict high-quality protein structures from sequence data, with the option to incorporate templates and advanced alignment techniques.

## Getting Started


- 
Each notebook can be accessed directly via the provided Colab links. Simply click on the "Open in Colab" button next to each notebook title to get started.

## Requirements

The notebooks are set up for Google Colab, where all necessary dependencies will be installed automatically upon execution. For local execution, please ensure that you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries as specified in each notebook.
